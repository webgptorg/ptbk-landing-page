# 📖 The Book Whitepaper

For most business applications nowadays, the biggest challenge isn't about the raw capabilities of AI models. Large language models like GPT-5 or Claude-4.1 are extremely capable.

The main challenge is to narrow it down, constrain it, set the proper **context, rules, knowledge, and personality**. There are a lot of tools which can do exactly this. On one side, there are no-code platforms which can launch your agent in seconds. On the other side, there are heavy frameworks like Langchain or Semantic Kernel, which can give you deep control.

Promptbook takes the best from both worlds. You are defining your AI behavior by simple **books**, which are very explicit. They are automatically enforced, but they are very easy to understand, very easy to write, and very reliable and portable.

## Aspects of great AI agent

We have created a language called **Book**, which allows you to write AI agents in their native language and create your own AI persona. Book provides a guide to define all the traits and commitments.

You can look at it as prompting (or writing a system message), but decorated by **commitments**.

### `Persona` commitment

Personas define the character of your AI persona, its role, and how it should interact with users. It sets the tone and style of communication.

PERSONA You are a company lawyer.
Your job is to provide legal advice and support to the company and its employees.
You are knowledgeable, professional, and detail-oriented.
```

### `Knowledge` commitment

Knowledge Commitment allows you to provide specific information, facts, or context that the AI should be aware of when responding.

This can include domain-specific knowledge, company policies, or any other relevant information.

Promptbook Engine will automatically enforce this knowledge during interactions. When the knowledge is short enough, it will be included in the prompt. When it is too long, it will be stored in vector databases and RAG retrieved when needed. But you don't need to care about it.

```

### `Rule` commitment

Rules will enforce specific behaviors or constraints on the AI's responses. This can include ethical guidelines, communication styles, or any other rules you want the AI to follow.

Depending on rule strictness, Promptbook will either propagate it to the prompt or use other techniques, like adversary agent, to enforce it.

RULE Never provide legal advice about criminal law.
KNOWLEDGE  https://company.com/company-policies.pdf

```

### `Action` commitment

Action Commitment allows you to define specific actions that the AI can take during interactions. This can include things like posting on a social media platform, sending emails, creating calendar events, or interacting with your internal systems.

## Where to use your AI agent in book

Books can be useful in various applications and scenarios. Here are some examples:

### Chat apps:

Create your own chat shopping assistant and place it in your eShop.
You will be able to answer customer questions, help them find products, and provide personalized recommendations. Everything is tightly controlled by the book you have written.

### Reply Agent:

Create your own AI agent, which will look at your emails and reply to them. It can even create drafts for you to review before sending.

### Coding Agent:

Do you love Vibecoding, but the AI code is not always aligned with your coding style and architecture, rules, security, etc.? Create your own coding agent to help enforce your specific coding standards and practices.

This can be integrated to almost any Vibecoding platform, like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Cursor, Cline, Kilocode, Roocode,...

They will work the same as you are used to, but with your specific rules written in book.

### Internal Expertise

Do you have an app written in TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, or any other language, and you are integrating the AI.

You can avoid struggle with choosing the best model, its settings like temperature, max tokens, etc., by writing a book agent and using it as your AI expertise.

Doesn't matter if you do automations, data analysis, customer support, sentiment analysis, classification, or any other task. Your AI agent will be tailored to your specific needs and requirements.

Even works in no-code platforms!
